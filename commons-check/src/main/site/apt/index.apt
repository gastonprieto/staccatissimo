About Staccato-Commons-IO
 
 Staccato-Commons-Check is the validation library of the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net}Staccato-Commons project}}. It offers classes for performing flexible preconditions and postcondition (defensive programming) and domain-specific validations, plus many annotations for performing simple checks, inspired on JSR303. It is at the lowest level of the staccato-commons projects hierarchy, and all the projects depend make an intensive usage of it  
 
Prealpha state 

 Staccato-Commons-Lang is still in a prealpha state, and although it fully implements most of previous features, documentation is not yet fully documented nor tested, and types and packages are likely to change in the near future without notice. It is not recommended to use it in production systems yet.
