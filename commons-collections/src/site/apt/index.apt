About Staccato-Commons-Collections 
 
 Staccato-Commons-Collection is the collections library of the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net}Staccato-Commons project}}. It is focused on providing new abstractions that mix object oriented and functional style for dealing with collections. It extend the existing Java Collections Framework adding, for example, filtering, mapping, folding, concatenating collections capabilities and much more. It also offers Streams, a lazy, collection-like hierarchy. On the ohter hand, Staccato-Commons-Collections is not aimed to provide new specific purpose collection implementations.    
 
Prealpha state 

 Staccato-Commons-Collection is still in a prealpha state, and although it fully implements most of previous features, documentation is not yet fully documented nor tested, and types and packages are likely to change in the near future without notice. It is not recomended to use it in production systems yet.
