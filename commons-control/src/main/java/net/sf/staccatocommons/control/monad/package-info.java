/**
 * This package contains the Monad type, a generic interface for building high-level, complex, potentially asynchronous control
 * structures,  borrowed from functional programming and adapted to Java and OOP world in order to make it 
 * simple to use, without requiring a special functional background.
 * 
 * It also contains the Monads hub, wich offers some common monad implementations and ways of combining them.
