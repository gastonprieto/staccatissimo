About Staccato-Commons-Lang 
 
 Staccato-Commons-Lang is the core library of the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net}Staccato-Commons project}}. It offers options, tuples, lazy values, functor object interfaces and abstract classes, builders, a generic validations ecosystem, lifecycles, ranges, sequences, generic serialization managers and variables formatting. 
 
Prealpha state 

 Staccato-Commons-Lang is still in a prealpha state, and although it fully implements most of previous features, documentation is not yet fully documented nor tested, and types and packages are likely to change in the near future without notice. It is not recommended to use it in production systems yet.
