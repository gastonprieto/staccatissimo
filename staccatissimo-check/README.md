#About Staccato-Commons-Check
 
 Staccato-Commons-Check is the validation library of the [Staccato-Commons project](http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net), which allows to perform generic and domain-specific preconditions and postconditions checks. It is is designed for being rich, easy to use and understand, flexible, extensible, and general purpose. 
  
 Please notice Staccato-Commons-Check is a validation API targeted for implementing fail-fast programming, like validation classes you can find in [Apache Commons Lang](http://commons.apache.org/lang/) or [Guava](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/). It is by no means a conversion and validation  API like [http://commons.apache.org/validator/](Apache Commons Validator)
 
 #Getting started

  Staccato-Commons-Check resolves problems related with implementing preconditions and postconditions checks.  Descriptions of such problems, solutions and examples can be found in the following links:
 * {{{./docs/api-walkthrough.html}API Walkthrough}} 
 * {{{./docs/check-by-example.html}Check by example}}
  

#What is next?

 * Navigate the [API javadoc](http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-check/apidocs/index.html)
 * Explore the rest of Staccato-Commons projects. They extensively use Staccato-Commons-Check
 * Have a look to the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-restrictions-instrument/}Staccato-Commons-Restricions-Instrument}} API,
which can instrument check annotations, by inserting at compile time calls to the Validation API previously described.
