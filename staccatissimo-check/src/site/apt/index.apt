About Staccatissimo-Check
 
 Staccatissimo-Check is the validation library of the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net}Staccatissimo project}}, 
 which allows to perform generic and domain-specific preconditions and postconditions checks. It is is designed 
 for being rich, easy to use and understand, flexible, extensible, and general purpose. 
  
 Please notice Staccatissimo-Check is a validation API targeted for implementing fail-fast programming, like validation 
classes you can find in {{{http://commons.apache.org/lang/}Apache Commons Lang}}
or {{{http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/}Guava}}. It is by no means a conversion and validation 
API like {{{http://commons.apache.org/validator/}Apache Commons Validator}}

 * Navigate the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-check/apidocs/index.html}API javadoc}}
 
 * Explore the rest of Staccatissimo projects. They extensively use Staccatissimo-Check
 
 * Have a look to the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-restrictions-instrument/}Staccatissimo-Restricions-Instrument}} API,
which can instrument check annotations, by inserting at compile time calls to the Validation API previously described.
