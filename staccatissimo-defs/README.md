#About Staccato-Commons-Defs 
 
 Staccato-Commons-Defs is the minimal definitions library of the [Staccato-Commons project](http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net).It provides very abstract interfaces with well defined but generic semantics, focused on code reuse.   
 
#Getting Started 

 Staccato-Commons-Defs contains no classes, but only interfaces and as such, it is not very useful by itself, but in combination with the rest of the Staccato-Commons projects. Those interfaces fall in the following categories: 
 
 * {{{./applicatives-by-example.html}Function-like}}: Applicables, Executables, Evaluables, Delayables, Thunks and Functions 
 * Collection-like types: SizeAwares, ContainsAwares, EmptyAwares 
 * NumberTypes  
 * ProtoMonads 
 * Tuples 
 * Reductions
