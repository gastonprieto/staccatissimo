#About Staccatissimo-Lang 
 
 Staccatissimo-Lang is the core library of the [StaccatoCommons project](http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net) 
 It provides abstract and concrete implementations of function-like interfaces of [Staccatissimo-Defs](http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-defs/index.html), as well as options, tuples, and builders.  
 
#Getting Started

  Staccatissimo-Lang resolves simple and common everyday problems. Descriptions of such problems, solutions and examples 
  can be found in the following links:
  
  * Abstract and concrete implementations of {{{../commons-defs/applicatives-by-example.html}applicables}} - function-like objects
  * {{{./relevant-state-by-example.html}RelevantState}} and BasicEquals
   - Consistently implementing equals, hashcode, toString, and/or compareTo in an efficient 
  way and without boilerplate code. 
  * Nulls and Option - Handling nulls and optional values
  * Builders - Templates for creating builder-pattern style objects
  * MapBuilder and CollectionBuilder - Builders for creating unmodifiable collections and maps
  * {{{./compare-by-example.html}Compare}} - Functions and utilities for comparing elements
  * Tuples
  * Predicates, Functions and Thunks - abstract and concrete implementations 
  of the rich, function-like interface defined by staccato-commons-defs
  * Equiv - Common equality relation implementations 
  * SoftExceptions
